# mgosi-news-pwa
    A news Progressive Web Application (PWA) that uses an offline first approach.

    Mgosi - A Xhosa word that means latest news _(well, gossip most of the time)_ but yeah

    * The app uses [Materialize framework](https://materializecss.com) for the UI
    * Mgosi implements the [newsapi.org](https://newsapi.org) and Javascript's FETCH API for news articles. NEWSAPI crawls and indexes news articles from over 30,000 news sources and blogs across the globe. 
    * The [FETCH API] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) was also used to administer the caching of both static and dynamic data that make the whole offline-first approach possible.

    It is not the best news PWA yet, but I needed to make it run on gh-pages so alot of stuff can probably be done better...
